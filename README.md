## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

*   **C++**: This directory is dedicated to solutions written in C++. It's further divided into several subdirectories:
    *   `prog_comp`: A major section for competitive programming exercises, which includes:
        *   `Estudios`: A space for study-related materials and algorithmic practice.
        *   `OCI`: Solutions for problems from the "Olimpíada Chilena de Informática" (OCI).
        *   `Probs`: A collection of problems sourced from various online judges.
            *   `kattis`: Solutions to problems from the Kattis platform.
            *   `usaco`: Solutions for problems from the USACO (USA Computing Olympiad).
        *   `Simuladas`: Problems from simulated programming contests, including national and regional competitions.
        *   `Training-Camp`: Materials and solutions from a coding training camp.

*   **CIPC**: This section holds all materials related to the CIPC event. It is structured by days (`Dia-1`, `Dia-2`, etc.) and includes an `Apunte` folder with notes in LaTeX format.

*   **Python**: This directory contains code and solutions written in Python, including the `ACOIIN` subdirectory for specific problems or projects.

## How to Use

Most of the solutions in this repository are written in C++. To compile and run them, you can use the `compile.sh` script located in the `C++/prog_comp` directory.

To run a specific solution, navigate to its directory and execute the script. Make sure to provide the necessary input files if required by the problem.
